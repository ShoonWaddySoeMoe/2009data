(2015)	Dr. Thin Thin Naing	Implementation of items Allocation Problem by using Bin Packing Algorithm	This system applies one-dimensional bin-packing algorithms for an item allocation problem. This system applies three types of product of purified drinking water delivery. A well-known one-dimensional bin packing problem solves for minimum number of bins to pack ’N’ items subject to various sizes; an item should be accommodated in a single bin.

(2015)	Dr.Thandar Aung	Web Page Structural Clustering Using TDSCAN Algorithm	A cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another within the same cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other clusters. Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in the same group, called cluster, in data mining. It is also a very powerful technique for topic discovery from text documents.

(2015)	Dr. Saw Thandar Myint	Reducing Pesticides Amount for Crops Using SEMI-EMPIRICAL And Linear Regression	Reducing the impact of pesticides on human health system is designed and implemented. The system will be used especially in human health protection. According to the World Health Organization(WHO) pesticides are the most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals to human.

(2015)	Dr.Zarni Sann	Simulation of Location Information Using Location-AIDED Routing Algorithm In Mobile Ad HOC Network(MANET)	A mobile ad hoc network hosts that may move often. Movement of hosts results in routes, requiring some mechanism for determining new routes. This system finds location information using Location-Aided routing algorithm

Former supervisor 
Dr. Mya Thet Saw	Congestion Control In Computer Network Using TCP RENO	Congestion control is concerned with allocating the resources in a network such that the network can operate at an acceptable performance level when the demand exceeds the capacity of the network resources. These resources include bandwidths of links, buffer space(memory),and processing capacity at intermediate nodes.

(2015)	Dr. Zarni Sann	Forecasting Stock Share Prices Using QUASI-NEWTON Algorithm In Artificial Neural Network	This system is based on historical data such as investment income, stock sale income, net income, and number of shares, total’s liabilities of past time. In this system, neural network is used to forecast future stock share price. This system has used four years(2008,2009,2010,2011)training data and tested one year(2012) that stored in SQL database.

(2015)	Dr.Swe Zin Aung	Sentence Extraction Using Coherent Chunk And Text Ranking Method	Automated summarization is an important area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Most of the summarization is based on extraction of sentences from the original document. In this system, political news is used to summarize.

(2015)	Daw Myint Myint Maw	Secure Message Transmission Using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
        (ECDSA)	Data security is needed for storing communication data and for ensuring that the source of the message has not altered. Message transmission over the internet can be altered. To solve this problem, digital signature is used to detect unauthorized users from modification of the data and also to authenticate the identity of the signatory.

(2009)	Daw Kalar Maw Thein Aye	Applicant Admission for Public Nursery School System Using AHP	Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the most widely used in solving Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) problems. The AHP is a decision support tool which can be used to solve complex decision problems. In this thesis we develop the system which will support the operational activities in the Applicant selection function. An application of AHP for admission procedure in public nursery school system is presented in this thesis. The specific problem under consideration is selection of applicants for public nursery school system. In this system , the selection of applicants is supported by AHP. This system will be implemented by C# programming language.
